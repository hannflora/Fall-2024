# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cocktail_data_clean <- cocktail_data %>% 
  # splitting ingredients into separate rows
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>") %>% # because of a typo
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4/>") %>% # another typo
  mutate(
      ingredients = ingredients %>%
        str_remove_all("\\b\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?\\s?(oz | dash | dashes | drop | drops | bsp)\\b") %>% # quantities
        str_remove_all("\\b\\d+/\\d+\\s?(oz | dash | dashes | drop | drops | bsp)\\b") %>% # fractions
        str_remove_all("\\b\\d+%\\s?(abv)\\b") %>% # alcohol content
        str_remove_all("\\([^)]*\\)") %>% # parentheses
        str_remove_all("(?<!\\d)\\b\\d+\\b(?!\\s*-proof)") %>% # standalone numbers but not "-proof"
        str_remove_all("/") %>% # stray slashes
        str_trim() # whitespace
  )

# correcting typos
cocktail_data_clean_corr <- cocktail_data_clean %>% 
  mutate(
    ingredients = case_when(
      str_detect(ingredients, "cacao") ~ "white creme de cacao", # replacing special character "Ã¨"
      str_detect(ingredients, "^simple$") ~ "simple syrup", # adding missing "syrup"
      str_detect(ingredients, "Marschino") ~ "Luxardo Maraschino", # correcting typo
      TRUE ~ ingredients
    )
  ) %>% 
  distinct()
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients. I need this in a table.

```{r}
ingredients_list <- cocktail_data_clean_corr %>% 
  select(ingredients) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  arrange(tolower(ingredients))

print(ingredients_list, n = "all")
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
nrow(ingredients_list)

# 60 different ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
ingredient_counts <- cocktail_data_clean_corr %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%  # counting occurrences of each ingredient
  arrange(desc(n)) # arranging by frequency

# identifying the 10th highest frequency
tenth_frequency <- ingredient_counts %>%
  select(n) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  slice(10) %>%
  pull(n)

# listing ingredients equal or above the 10th highest frequency
top_10_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(n >= tenth_frequency)

# printing ingredients
print(top_10_ingredients, n = "all")
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
# counting number of ingredients per cocktail
cocktail_ingredient_count <- cocktail_data_clean_corr %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(ingredient_count = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

# identifying highest ingredient count
max_ingredients <- max(cocktail_ingredient_count$ingredient_count)

# listing cocktails with the highest ingredient count
top_ingredient_cocktails <- cocktail_ingredient_count %>%
  filter(ingredient_count == max_ingredients)

top_ingredient_cocktails
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}
# filtering ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
ingredients_in_one_cocktail <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(n == 1)

# counting rare ingredients
nrow(ingredients_in_one_cocktail)

# 26 rare ingredients
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
rare_ingredient_cocktails <- ingredients_in_one_cocktail %>% 
  inner_join(cocktail_data_clean_corr, by = "ingredients") %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  distinct()

print(rare_ingredient_cocktails, n = "all")
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
no_rare_ing_cocktails <- cocktail_data_clean_corr %>% 
  anti_join(rare_ingredient_cocktails, by = "name") %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  distinct()

print(no_rare_ing_cocktails, n = "all")
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
cheat_sheet <- cocktail_data_clean_corr %>%
  arrange(tolower(ingredients)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, 
              values_from = ingredients, 
              values_fn = length,
              values_fill = list(ingredients = NA)) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(across(absinthe:yellow_chartreuse, ~ ifelse(is.na(.), "", "X"))) %>% 
  select(name, absinthe:yellow_chartreuse) %>% 
  arrange(tolower(name))

# viewing the entire sheet
view(cheat_sheet)

# printing example
example_cheat_sheet <- cheat_sheet[36:53, ] %>% 
  select(name, angostura_bitters:campari)
  
knitr::kable(example_cheat_sheet)
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
